linked to the interface you will use to access the raspberries), call it with this name:
$SwitchName = "DockerNAT"
# Run from PowerShell console as Administrator with the command:
#   powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File C:\Users\drago\IdeaProjects\master_thesisB\infrastructure\RasPIs-environment\docker-machine-pcmanager-raspis\swarm-raspi-setup-step1.ps1
# Swarm mode using Docker Machine
